Hello fellow physics students!

I wrote this program to assist with the AP Physics 1 Test. This program can ONLY be run on the TI-84 Plus CE/ Silver Addition calculators. If you have a TI-84 Plus calculator I have a modified program for that model calculator.

This program is capable of solving for variables in Kinematics, Energy/Work, Momentum/Impulse, Force, Projectile Motion, Center Of Mass. 
On top of this you can do Vector Sums, and there is a short list of equations that are invaluable for the test but do not appear on the equation sheet.

This program comes in two parts, the main program, APHYSICS, and KINEMATS a secondary program. You must install both these programs onto your calculator
in order for the program to work. When running the program select the one named APHYSICS, this will forward you to the main menu. 

Know that this program is designed for SI Units and that it's easy to encounter errors if attempting to use other units.

One of the features I have included is the ability to change the acceleration induced by gravity. By default it is set to 10 m/s^2. If you would like to
change this, it is one of the options featured on the menu. Be sure to know that when you restart the program (exit and reenter, or turn Calculator off and back on)
the acceleration will reset to 10 m/s^2. 

Note that I will be taking AP Physics C this year and will most likely come out with a new calculator program that incorporates calculus. Stay tuned!

If you have any questions or concerns with the program, don't hesitate to reach out at:
